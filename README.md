# ParkShark

### A marketplace that helps people find non-traditional parking

ParkShark establishes a platform for people to buy and sell parking spaces.

Unlike other platforms out there, ParkShark doesn't just connect people to parking garages or existing lots. It actually creates new parking spots that otherwise wouldn't exist!

Homeowners with driveways (or any kind of private street parking) can put up their personal parking spaces up for rent when they're not using the space to earn some extra cash.

### For Parking-Seekers

For parking-seekers, the goal of ParkShark is to reduce the cost of parking and the hassle of finding parking, especially at events like sports arenas, stadiums, and airports.

### For Parking-Renters

For parking-renters, the goal of ParkShark is to allow them to earn cash with an otherwise unused asset.

Imagine you live near a busy airport or stadium. With ParkShark, you would be able to rent out your driveway on a consistent basis and earn cash on a consistent basis!
